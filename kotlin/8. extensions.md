### **Extensions in Kotlin**

In Kotlin, you can **extend** the functionality of existing classes without modifying their source code. 
This is achieved through **extension functions**, **extension properties**, and **operator overloading**. 
These features make the code more expressive, readable, and maintainable.

Let's dive deeper into each of these concepts with examples.

## **1. Extension Functions** üîß

An **extension function** allows you to add new functionality to a class without modifying its code. 
Even though the function is defined outside the class, it can be called on objects of that class as if it were part of the class.

### **Syntax**:
```kotlin
fun ClassName.functionName(): ReturnType {
    // function body
}
```

### **Example: Extension Function on `String`**

Let‚Äôs define an extension function `lastChar()` for the `String` class, which returns the last character of the string.

```kotlin
fun String.lastChar(): Char = this[this.length - 1]

fun main() {
    val str = "Kotlin"
    println(str.lastChar())  // Output: n
}
```

- **`String.lastChar()`**: Adds a function `lastChar` to the `String` class.
- **`this[this.length - 1]`**: Refers to the last character of the string using `this`.

Even though `lastChar` is defined outside the `String` class, we can call it like a regular method on any `String` object.

## **2. Extension Properties** üè∑Ô∏è

An **extension property** allows you to add a property to an existing class. 
Extension properties are not part of the class itself but provide a way to get or set values using a getter.

### **Syntax**:
```kotlin
val ClassName.propertyName: Type
    get() = // return value
```

### **Example: Extension Property for `String`**

Here‚Äôs an extension property `lastChar` for the `String` class, which returns the last character of the string.

```kotlin
val String.lastChar: Char
    get() = this[this.length - 1]

fun main() {
    val str = "Kotlin"
    println(str.lastChar)  // Output: n
}
```

- **`lastChar`**: This is an extension property that retrieves the last character of the string.
- **`get()`**: Defines how to fetch the value of `lastChar`.

Extension properties behave like regular properties of the class, and you can access them directly on the `String` object.

## **3. Operator Overloading** ‚ûï‚ûñ

**Operator overloading** allows you to define custom behavior for standard operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc., for your custom types. This helps in making the code more intuitive when working with custom objects.

### **Syntax**:
To overload an operator, you define a function with a special name that matches the operator.

```kotlin
operator fun ClassName.operatorSymbol(other: Type): ReturnType {
    // function body
}
```

### **Example: Overloading `+` Operator for a `Point` Class**

Here‚Äôs an example of overloading the `+` operator to add two `Point` objects together.

```kotlin
data class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int) {
    operator fun plus(other: Point): Point {
        return Point(this.x + other.x, this.y + other.y)
    }
}

fun main() {
    val point1 = Point(1, 2)
    val point2 = Point(3, 4)
    
    val result = point1 + point2  // Using overloaded `+` operator
    println(result)  // Output: Point(x=4, y=6)
}
```

- **`operator fun plus()`**: This function overloads the `+` operator to add two `Point` objects together.
- **`this.x + other.x, this.y + other.y`**: Defines how to add the corresponding coordinates of the two points.

You can now use the `+` operator between two `Point` objects, which is more intuitive and expressive.

|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Extension Functions**  | Add new functions to existing classes without modifying them.                         |
| **Extension Properties** | Add new properties to existing classes, allowing access like built-in properties.     |
| **Operator Overloading** | Define custom behavior for standard operators like `+`, `-`, etc. for your own types. |

These features in Kotlin enhance code readability and expressiveness by allowing you to add functionality to classes without changing their source code.
