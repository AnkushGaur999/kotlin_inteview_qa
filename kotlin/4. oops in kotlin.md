### Object Oriented Programming in Kotlin

## **1. Classes & Objects**

Kotlin is an object-oriented programming language, which means it uses classes to define the structure of objects.
A class is a blueprint, while an object is an instance of that class.

### **Class Declaration**:
```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
    fun greet() {
        println("Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.")
    }
}
```
- `class Person`: Declares a class named `Person`.
- `val name: String` and `var age: Int`: Two properties that the `Person` class will have.
- `greet()`: A method that the `Person` class defines.

### **Creating an Object (Instance)**:
```kotlin
val person = Person("Alice", 30)  // Creating an object of Person
person.greet()  // Calling method greet() on the object
```
- `person` is an instance of the `Person` class, and you can access its methods and properties.

---

## **2. Constructors (Primary & Secondary)**

Kotlin classes have two types of constructors: **primary** and **secondary**.
The **primary constructor** is defined in the class header, while **secondary constructors** are defined inside the class body.

### **Primary Constructor**:
The primary constructor is part of the class header and is used to initialize properties of the class.

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
    fun greet() {
        println("Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.")
    }
}
```
- `val name: String` and `var age: Int` are parameters of the primary constructor.
- Properties are automatically initialized from the constructor parameters.

### **Secondary Constructor**:
Secondary constructors are defined inside the class body using the `constructor` keyword.

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String) {
    var age: Int = 0

    // Secondary constructor
    constructor(name: String, age: Int) : this(name) {
        this.age = age
    }

    fun greet() {
        println("Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.")
    }
}

val person1 = Person("Alice")  // Uses primary constructor
val person2 = Person("Bob", 30)  // Uses secondary constructor
```
- The secondary constructor can call the primary constructor using `: this(name)`.
- You can initialize additional properties in the secondary constructor.

## **3. Inheritance (Open, Override)**

In Kotlin, a class is **final** by default, meaning it cannot be inherited unless it is explicitly marked as `open`. Similarly, methods and properties are **final** by default, so they must be marked with `open` to allow overriding in subclasses.

### **Base Class (Parent)**:
```kotlin
open class Animal(val name: String) {  // `open` allows inheritance
    open fun makeSound() {  // `open` allows overriding
        println("Some generic animal sound")
    }
}
```
- `open class Animal`: This marks the `Animal` class as inheritable.
- `open fun makeSound()`: This allows the method to be overridden in subclasses.

### **Derived Class (Child)**:
```kotlin
class Dog(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    override fun makeSound() {  // `override` allows overriding the base class method
        println("Bark")
    }
}
```
- `class Dog(name: String) : Animal(name)`: Inherits from the `Animal` class.
- `override fun makeSound()`: The `Dog` class overrides the `makeSound()` method of the `Animal` class.

### **Using the Classes**:
```kotlin
val dog = Dog("Rex")
dog.makeSound()  // Output: Bark
```

---

## **4. Abstract Classes & Interfaces**

### **Abstract Classes**:
An **abstract class** cannot be instantiated directly. 
It can have abstract methods (which must be overridden in subclasses) as well as non-abstract methods.

```kotlin
abstract class Shape {
    abstract fun area(): Double  // Abstract method, must be overridden

    fun display() {  // Non-abstract method
        println("Displaying the shape")
    }
}

class Circle(val radius: Double) : Shape() {
    override fun area(): Double {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius
    }
}

val circle = Circle(5.0)
println(circle.area())  // Output: 78.53981633974483
```
- `abstract class Shape`: Declares an abstract class.
- `abstract fun area()`: Declares an abstract method.
- The subclass `Circle` must override the `area()` method.

### **Interfaces**:
An **interface** can be implemented by classes, and it can contain abstract methods, 
but it can also provide default implementations.

```kotlin
interface Movable {
    fun move()  // Abstract method

    fun stop() {  // Default implementation
        println("Stopping")
    }
}

class Car : Movable {
    override fun move() {
        println("Car is moving")
    }
}

val car = Car()
car.move()  // Output: Car is moving
car.stop()  // Output: Stopping
```
- `interface Movable`: Declares an interface.
- `move()`: Abstract method to be implemented by `Car`.
- `stop()`: Provides a default implementation.

---

## **5. Visibility Modifiers**

Kotlin provides several visibility modifiers to control the access level of classes, methods, and properties:

### **Public**:
- **Default visibility** for classes, methods, and properties.
- Accessible from anywhere in the code.

```kotlin
class Person {
    public val name = "Alice"  // Can be accessed from anywhere
}
```

### **Private**:
- Only accessible within the same class or file (if used at the file level).

```kotlin
class Person {
    private val name = "Alice"  // Can only be accessed inside the class
    fun printName() {
        println(name)  // Accessible inside the class
    }
}
```

### **Protected**:
- Accessible within the class and its subclasses.

```kotlin
open class Animal {
    protected val name = "Animal"  // Accessible in subclass
}

class Dog : Animal() {
    fun printName() {
        println(name)  // Accessible because Dog is a subclass of Animal
    }
}
```

### **Internal**:
- Accessible within the same module (a module is typically a project or library).

```kotlin
internal class Person {
    internal val name = "Alice"  // Accessible within the same module
}
```

### **Visibility Modifiers Summary**

| Modifier    | Visibility Description                          |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `public`    | Accessible from anywhere (default modifier).    |
| `private`   | Accessible only within the same class or file.  |
| `protected` | Accessible within the class and its subclasses. |
| `internal`  | Accessible within the same module.              |

|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classes & Objects**    | Classes are blueprints; objects are instances of those classes.                    |
| **Constructors**         | Primary constructor in class header; secondary constructors in the body.           |
| **Inheritance**          | `open` allows inheritance; `override` allows method overriding.                    |
| **Abstract Classes**     | Cannot be instantiated; contains abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses. |
| **Interfaces**           | Can be implemented by classes; can provide default method implementations.         |
| **Visibility Modifiers** | Control access levels: `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`.               |
