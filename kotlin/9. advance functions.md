### Advance Functions

### 1. **Recursion**

**What is recursion?**
Recursion is when a function calls itself in order to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. 
It is a powerful tool for breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable pieces.

#### Key Points:
- **Base Case**: A recursive function must have a base case to prevent infinite recursion. The base case is the condition under which the function will stop calling itself.
- **Recursive Case**: This is the part of the function where it calls itself to break the problem into smaller subproblems.

#### Example: Calculating Factorial using Recursion

A factorial of a number `n` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n`. For example:
```
Factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```

```kotlin
fun factorial(n: Int): Int {
    // Base case: when n is 0 or 1, return 1
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1
    // Recursive case: multiply n with the factorial of (n - 1)
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
}

fun main() {
    println(factorial(5))  // Output: 120
}
```

**Flow of Execution**:
1. `factorial(5)` returns `5 * factorial(4)`
2. `factorial(4)` returns `4 * factorial(3)`
3. `factorial(3)` returns `3 * factorial(2)`
4. `factorial(2)` returns `2 * factorial(1)`
5. `factorial(1)` reaches the base case and returns 1
6. All the recursive calls now resolve: `2 * 1 = 2`, `3 * 2 = 6`, `4 * 6 = 24`, `5 * 24 = 120`

### 2. **Tail Recursion**

**What is tail recursion?**
Tail recursion is a special form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation performed before returning the result. 
Tail-recursive functions are optimized by the compiler or interpreter to avoid building up stack frames for each recursive call, making them more efficient.

**Why is tail recursion important?**
Without tail recursion, each recursive call creates a new stack frame, which can result in a stack overflow for deep recursion. 
Tail recursion avoids this issue by reusing the current function’s stack frame.

#### Example: Tail Recursive Factorial

Let’s rewrite the factorial function to be tail-recursive by adding an accumulator that stores the intermediate result:

```kotlin
fun factorialTailRec(n: Int, accumulator: Int = 1): Int {
    // Base case: when n is 0, return the accumulated result
    if (n == 0) return accumulator
    // Tail-recursive call: multiply n with accumulator and recurse
    return factorialTailRec(n - 1, n * accumulator)
}

fun main() {
    println(factorialTailRec(5))  // Output: 120
}
```

**Flow of Execution**:
- The accumulator holds the result as the function recurses.
- When `factorialTailRec(5)` is called, it returns `factorialTailRec(4, 5)` with `5 * 1`.
- This continues until the base case (`n == 0`) is reached, at which point the result is returned without needing to resolve intermediate calls in reverse order.

**Why is this optimized?**
Since the recursive call is the last action in the function, the compiler can optimize it to avoid creating new stack frames.

### 3. **Currying**

**What is currying?**
Currying is a functional programming technique in which a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument and returning another function. This allows you to partially apply arguments to a function, making it more flexible and reusable.

#### Example: Currying in Kotlin

Suppose we have a function that takes two integers and returns their product:

```kotlin
fun multiply(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
    return x * y
}

fun main() {
    println(multiply(2, 3)) // Output: 6
}
```

We can "curry" this function by transforming it into a series of functions that each take one argument:

```kotlin
fun multiply(x: Int): (Int) -> Int {
    return { y -> x * y } // Returns a function that takes y and multiplies with x
}

fun main() {
    val multiplyBy2 = multiply(2) // Partially applied function
    println(multiplyBy2(3)) // Output: 6
    println(multiplyBy2(5)) // Output: 10
}
```

**How does this work?**
- The function `multiply(x)` takes a single argument `x` and returns another function that accepts the second argument `y`.
- Now, `multiplyBy2` is a function that multiplies any given number by 2. You can reuse this `multiplyBy2` function with different values of `y`.

**Benefits of Currying**:
- **Partial Application**: Currying allows partial application, where you can create a function with one argument fixed, making the code more reusable.
- **Functional Composition**: Currying enables composing multiple small functions together to form more complex behavior.

### 4. **Function References**

**What are function references?**
In Kotlin, you can pass a function as a value to another function. This allows you to treat functions as first-class citizens, enabling higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments).

#### Example: Passing Function References

```kotlin
fun square(x: Int): Int {
    return x * x
}

fun applyFunction(x: Int, func: (Int) -> Int): Int {
    return func(x) // Applying the passed function to x
}

fun main() {
    // Passing a function reference
    println(applyFunction(5, ::square)) // Output: 25
}
```

**How does this work?**
- `::square` is a function reference that refers to the `square` function.
- This reference is passed as an argument to the `applyFunction` function, which calls the passed function with the argument `x`.

**Why use function references?**
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Function references enable you to pass functions to other functions, which is essential for functional programming.
- **Cleaner Code**: Using function references can make your code more concise and easier to read compared to passing anonymous lambdas.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Recursion** is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It requires a base case to stop the recursion.
- **Tail Recursion** optimizes recursion by making the recursive call the last operation in the function, preventing stack overflow and enabling better performance.
- **Currying** transforms a function with multiple arguments into a series of functions each taking a single argument. It enables partial application and functional composition.
- **Function References** allow you to treat functions as first-class citizens, passing them as arguments to other functions for greater flexibility and reuse.
